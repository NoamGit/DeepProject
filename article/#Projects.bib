abstract = {Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and other fluorescence microscopy techniques in which a focused sheet of light serves to illuminate the sample have become increasingly popular in developmental studies. Fluorescence light-sheet microscopy bridges the gap in image quality between fluorescence stereomicroscopy and high-resolution imaging of fixed tissue sections. In addition, high depth penetration, low bleaching and high acquisition speeds make light-sheet microscopy ideally suited for extended time-lapse experiments in live embryos. This review compares the benefits and challenges of light-sheet microscopy with established fluorescence microscopy techniques such as confocal microscopy and discusses the different implementations and applications of this easily adaptable technology.},

@article{Kim2014d,
abstract = {How does the mammalian retina detect motion? This classic problem in visual neuroscience has remained unsolved for 50 years. In search of clues, here we reconstruct Off-type starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and bipolar cells (BCs) in serial electron microscopic images with help from EyeWire, an online community of 'citizen neuroscientists'. On the basis of quantitative analyses of contact area and branch depth in the retina, we find evidence that one BC type prefers to wire with a SAC dendrite near the SAC soma, whereas another BC type prefers to wire far from the soma. The near type is known to lag the far type in time of visual response. A mathematical model shows how such 'space-time wiring specificity' could endow SAC dendrites with receptive fields that are oriented in space-time and therefore respond selectively to stimuli that move in the outward direction from the soma.},

@article{Warland1997a,
abstract = {Decoding visual information from a population of retinal ganglion cells. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2336-2350, 1997. This work investigates how a time-dependent visual stimulus is encoded by the collective activity of many retinal ganglion cells. Multiple ganglion cell spike trains were recorded simultaneously from the isolated retina of the tiger salamander using a multielectrode array. The stimulus consisted of photopic, spatially uniform, temporally broadband flicker. From the recorded spike trains, an estimate was obtained of the stimulus intensity as a function of time. This was compared with the actual stimulus to assess the quality and quantity of visual information conveyed by the ganglion cell population. Two algorithms were used to decode the spike trains: an optimized linear filter in which each action potential made an additive contribution to the stimulus estimate and an artificial neural network trained by back-propagation to match spike trains with stimuli. The two methods performed indistinguishably, suggesting that most of the information about this stimulus can be extracted by linear operations on the spike trains. Individual ganglion cells conveyed information at a rate of 3.2 +/- 1.7 bits/s (mean +/- SD), with an average information content per spike of 1.6 bits. The maximal possible rate of information transmission compatible with the measured spiking statistics was 13.9 +/- 6.3 bits/s. On average, ganglion cells used 22{\%} of this capacity to encode visual information. When a decoder received two spike trains of the same response type, the reconstruction improved only marginally over that obtained from a single cell. However, a decoder using an ON and an OFF cell extracted as much information as the sum of that obtained from each cell alone.Thus cells of opposite response type encode different and nonoverlapping features of the stimulus. As more spike trains were provided to the decoder, the total information rate rapidly saturated, with 79{\%} of the maximal value obtained from a local cluster of just four neurons of different functional types. The decoding filter applied to a given neuron's spikes within such a multiunit decoder differed substantially from the filter applied to that same neuron in a single-unit decoder. This shows that the optimal interpretation of a ganglion cell's action potential depends strongly on the simultaneous activity of other nearby cells. The quality of the stimulus reconstruction varied greatly with frequency: flicker components below 1 Hz and above 10 Hz were reconstructed poorly, and the performance was optimal near 2.5 Hz. Further analysis suggests that temporal encoding by ganglion cell spike trains is limited by slow phototransduction in the cone photoreceptors and a corrupting noise source proximal to the cones.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel approach for a complete functional identification of biophysical spike-processing neural circuits. The circuits considered accept multidimensional spike trains as their input and comprise a multitude of temporal receptive fields and conductance-based models of action potential generation. Each temporal receptive field describes the spatiotemporal contribution of all synapses between any two neurons and incorporates the (passive) processing carried out by the dendritic tree. The aggregate dendritic current produced by a multitude of temporal receptive fields is encoded into a sequence of action potentials by a spike generator modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system. Our approach builds on the observation that during any experiment, an entire neural circuit, including its receptive fields and biophysical spike generators, is projected onto the space of stimuli used to identify the circuit. Employing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of trigonometric polynomials to describe input stimuli, we quantitatively describe the relationship between underlying circuit parameters and their projections. We also derive experimental conditions under which these projections converge to the true parameters. In doing so, we achieve the mathematical tractability needed to characterize the biophysical spike generator and identify the multitude of receptive fields. The algorithms obviate the need to repeat experiments in order to compute the neurons' rate of response, rendering our methodology of interest to both experimental and theoretical neuroscientists.},

abstract = {The detection of image motion is fundamental to vision. In many species, unique classes of retinal ganglion cells selectively respond to visual stimuli that move in specific directions. It is not known which retinal cell first performs the neural computations that give rise to directional selectivity in the ganglion cell. A prominent candidate has been an interneuron called the 'starburst amacrine cell'. Using two-photon optical recordings of intracellular calcium concentration, here we find that individual dendritic branches of starburst cells act as independent computation modules. Dendritic calcium signals, but not somatic membrane voltage, are directionally selective for stimuli that move centrifugally from the cell soma. This demonstrates that direction selectivity is computed locally in dendritic branches at a stage before ganglion cells.},

However, population imaging has been hindered by the effective loading of synthetic fluorescent indicators, especially in the mature tissue. We have therefore developed an electroporation method to label the complete ganglion cell layer of the adult mammalian retina. We optimized the protocol such that the retina recovers from electroporation and generates responses to visual stimuli. The method can be used with a diverse set of indicators with a range of affinities and emission wavelengths. It therefore can be combined with transgenic animals expressing fluorescent markers to target specific neuronal types. Importantly, the ganglion cell layer remains accessible for subsequent intracellular recording and morphological identification.},

This method allows the manipulation of gene expression in the rodent brain with excellent spatiotemporal control; essentially any brain region of choice can be targeted and cells (or a subpopulation of cells) in that region can be stably genetically altered at any postnatal developmental stage up to adulthood. Many aspects of the method, its versatility, ease of application and high reproducibility, make it an attractive approach for studying genetic, cellular and circuit functions in the brain.

@article{Pillow2008b,
abstract = {Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20{\%} more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40{\%} more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

abstract = {Temporal focusing is a simple approach for achieving tight, optically sectioned excitation in nonlinear microscopy and multiphoton photo-manipulation. Key applications and advantages of temporal focusing involve propagation through scattering media, but the progressive broadening of the temporal focus has not been characterized. By combining a detailed geometrical optics model with Monte-Carlo scattering simulations we introduce and validate a simulation strategy for predicting temporal focusing characteristics in scattering and non-scattering media. The broadening of the temporal focus width with increasing depth in brain tissue is studied using both simulations and experiments for several key optical geometries, and an analytical approximation is found for the dependence of this broadening on the microscope's parameters in a transparent medium. Our results indicate that a multiphoton temporal focus has radically different broadening characteristics in deep tissue than those of a spatial focus.},

abstract = {In adult ferrets, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) responsive to increased (On) or decreased (Off) illumination convey information to different cellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). These dLGN sublaminae emerge during development when RGCs are found to undergo correlated spontaneous bursting activity. Using Ca2+ imaging and intracellular dye-filling techniques, we demonstrate here that in ferret neonates, morphologically identified On and Off beta RGCs have similar burst frequencies prior to the segregation of their inputs in the dLGN, but during the segregation period, they develop distinct burst frequencies. Although the bursts of On cells and Off cells occur synchronously, On cells burst only 25{\%}-35{\%} of the time that Off cells do. This change in the temporal bursting patterns of On and Off RGCs may underlie the segregation of their inputs on dLGN neurons.},

@article{Trask2015a,
abstract = {Neural word representations have proven useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their ability to efficiently model complex semantic and syntactic word relationships. However, most techniques model only one representation per word, despite the fact that a single word can have multiple meanings or "senses". Some techniques model words by using multiple vectors that are clustered based on context. However, recent neural approaches rarely focus on the application to a consuming NLP algorithm. Furthermore, the training process of recent word-sense models is expensive relative to single-sense embedding processes. This paper presents a novel approach which addresses these concerns by modeling multiple embeddings for each word based on supervised disambiguation, which provides a fast and accurate way for a consuming NLP model to select a sense-disambiguated embedding. We demonstrate that these embeddings can disambiguate both contrastive senses such as nominal and verbal senses as well as nuanced senses such as sarcasm. We further evaluate Part-of-Speech disambiguated embeddings on neural dependency parsing, yielding a greater than 8{\%} average error reduction in unlabeled attachment scores across 6 languages.},

Available recording methods are limited in their scope: electrodes can access only a small fraction of neurons at once, whereas synthetic fluorescent indicator dyes label tissue indiscriminately. Here, we describe a method for studying retinal circuitry at cellular and subcellular levels combining two-photon microscopy and a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using specific viral and promoter constructs to drive expression of GCaMP3, we labeled all five major neuron classes in the adult mouse retina. Stimulus-evoked GCaMP3 responses as imaged by two-photon microscopy permitted functional cell type annotation. Fluorescence responses were similar to those measured with the small molecule dye OGB-1. Fluorescence intensity correlated linearly with spike rates {\textgreater}10 spikes/s, and a significant change in fluorescence always reflected a significant change in spike firing rate. GCaMP3 expression had no apparent effect on neuronal function. Imaging at subcellular resolution showed compartment-specific calcium dynamics in multiple identified cell types.},

We obtained fluorescence measurements from 34-91 layer 2/3 neurons at a 180-490 Hz sampling rate. We detected single action potential-evoked calcium transients with signal-to-noise ratios of 2-5 and determined spike times with near-millisecond precision and 5-15 ms confidence intervals. An automated 'peeling' algorithm enabled reconstruction of complex spike trains from fluorescence traces up to 20-30 Hz frequency, uncovering spatiotemporal trial-to-trial variability of sensory responses in barrel cortex and visual cortex.

We classify based on cosine similarity of vectors derived from the contexts in unlabeled query and labeled example sentences. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results when using the WordNet sense inventory, and significantly better than baseline performance using the New Oxford American Dictionary inventory.

In addition, it is chal- lenging to generate sufficient high quality labeled data for supervised models with low cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization model to incorporate both local and global evidence from multi- ple tweets through three fine-grained re- lations. In order to identify semantically- related mentions for collective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic rela- tions through social networks.

Using a custom UV stimulation system and in vivo calcium imaging, we characterized the feature selectivity of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). In adult mice, a comparable percentage of the neuronal population responds to UV and visible stimuli, with similar pattern selectivity and receptive field properties. In young mice, the orientation selectivity for UV stimuli increased steadily during development, but not direction selectivity. Our results suggest that, by expanding the spectral window through which the mouse can acquire visual information, UV sensitivity provides an important component for mouse vision.},

abstract = {Electrical stimulation of neurons in brain slices evokes increases in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) in neighboring astrocytes. The present study tests whether similar neuron-to-glial signaling occurs in the isolated rat retina in response to light stimulation. Results demonstrate that M{\"{u}}ller cells, the principal retinal glial cells, generate transient increases in Ca(2+) under constant illumination. A flickering light stimulus increases the occurrence of these Ca(2+) transients. Antidromic activation of ganglion cell axons also increases the generation of M{\"{u}}ller cell Ca(2+) transients. The increases in Ca(2+) transients evoked by light and antidromic stimulation are blocked by the purinergic antagonist suramin and by TTX. The addition of adenosine greatly potentiates the response to light, with light ON evoking large Ca(2+) increases in M{\"{u}}ller cells. Suramin, apyrase (an ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme), and TTX substantially reduce the adenosine-potentiated response. NMDA, metabotropic glutamate, GABA(B), and muscarinic receptor antagonists, in contrast, are mainly ineffective in blocking the response. Light-evoked Ca(2+) responses begin in M{\"{u}}ller cell processes within the inner plexiform (synaptic) layer of the retina and then spread into cell endfeet at the inner retinal surface. These results represent the first demonstration that Ca(2+) increases in CNS glia can be evoked by a natural stimulus (light flashes). The results suggest that neuron-to-glia signaling in the retina is mediated by neuronal release of ATP, most likely from amacrine and/or ganglion cells, and that the response is augmented under pathological conditions when adenosine levels increase.},

abstract = {The ability to perform optical sectioning is one of the great advantages of laser-scanning microscopy. This introduces, however, a number of difficulties due to the scanning process, such as lower frame rates due to the serial acquisition process. Here we show that by introducing spatiotemporal pulse shaping techniques to multiphoton microscopy it is possible to obtain full-frame depth resolved imaging completely without scanning. Our method relies on temporal focusing of the illumination pulse. The pulsed excitation field is compressed as it propagates through the sample, reaching its shortest duration at the focal plane, before stretching again beyond it. This method is applied to obtain depth-resolved twophoton excitation fluorescence (TPEF) images of drosophila egg-chambers with nearly 105 effective pixels using a standard Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator.},

For large collections, it is clearly impractical to consider all possible groupings of mentions into distinct entities. To solve the problem we propose two ideas: (a) a distributed inference technique that uses parallelism to enable large scale processing, and (b) a hierarchical model of coreference that represents uncertainty over multiple granularities of entities to facilitate more effective approximate inference. To evaluate these ideas, we constructed a labeled corpus of 1.5 million disambiguated mentions in Web pages by selecting link anchors referring to Wikipedia entities. We show that the combination of the hierarchical model with distributed inference quickly obtains high accuracy (with error reduction of 38{\%}) on this large dataset, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.},

abstract = {There are two subclasses of alpha cell in the mammalian retina, which are morphologically identical in plain view but have opposite responses to a luminance change: one is ON center and the other is OFF center. Recent studies have shown that the neural circuitries, which underlie light responses in such ON- and OFF-ganglion cell pairs, are not mirror symmetric with respect to the ON and OFF pathways (Pang et al., 2003; Zaghloul et al., 2003; Murphy {\&} Rieke, 2006). This study examines alpha-cell homologues in the mouse retina and elucidates the synaptic mechanisms that generate their light responses. Morphological analysis of recorded cells revealed three subclasses that were essentially identical in plan view but had distinct vertical stratification levels. We refer to these cells as the sustained ON (ON-S), sustained OFF (OFF-S), and transient OFF (OFF-T) cells (Murphy {\&} Rieke, 2006; Margolis {\&} Detwiler, 2007). Both ON-S and OFF-S cells were largely driven through the ON pathway via changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively. Light responses of OFF-T cells were driven by transient changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Light responses of OFF-S cells were also measured in connexin 36 knockout mice in order to dissect glycinergic input arising from AII amacrine cells. At photopic/mesopic intensities, peak glycinergic input to OFF-S cells in the connexin 36 knockout mouse was reduced by {\~{}}85{\%} compared to OFF-S cells in the wild-type retina. This is consistent with the idea that AII cells receive their input from ON-cone bipolar cells through gap junctions and in turn provide glycinergic inhibition to OFF-S cells.},

abstract = {Dendritic signals play an essential role in processing visual information in the retina. To study them in neurites too small for electrical recording, we developed an instrument that combines a multi-photon (MP) microscope with a through-the-objective high-resolution visual stimulator. An upright microscope was designed that uses the objective lens for both MP imaging and delivery of visual stimuli to functionally intact retinal explants or eyecup preparations. The stimulator consists of a miniature liquid-crystal-on-silicon display coupled into the optical path of an infrared-excitation laser-scanning microscope. A pair of custom-made dichroic filters allows light from the excitation laser and three spectral bands ('colors') from the stimulator to reach the retina, leaving two intermediate bands for fluorescence imaging. Special optics allow displacement of the stimulator focus relative to the imaging focus. Spatially resolved changes in calcium-indicator fluorescence in response to visual stimuli were recorded in dendrites of different types of mammalian retinal neurons.},

Complementary to physics- and chemistry-based methods, genetic tools tap into intrinsic cellular and developmental mechanisms. Thus, they have the potential to achieve appropriate spatiotemporal resolution and the cellular-molecular specificity necessary for observing and probing the makings and inner workings of neurons and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, genetic analysis will be key to unraveling the intricate link from genes to circuits to systems, in part through systematic targeting and tracking of individual cellular components of neural circuits. Here we review recent progress in genetic tool development and advances in genetic analysis of neural circuits in the mouse. We also discuss future directions and implications for understanding brain disorders.},

This instrument allowed us to investigate the impact of the laser beam aberrations on two-photon autofluorescence imaging of human retinal tissues. We demonstrated that nonlinear microscopy images are improved when laser beam aberrations are minimized by realigning the laser system cavity while wavefront controlling. Nonlinear signals from several human retinal anatomical features have been detected for the first time, without the need of fixation or staining procedures. Beyond the improved image quality, this approach reduces the required excitation power levels, minimizing the side effects of phototoxicity within the imaged sample. In particular, this may be important to study the physiology and function of the healthy and diseased retina.},

abstract = {A number of studies of the motor system suggest that the majority of primary motor cortical neurons represent simple movement-related kinematic and dynamic quantities in their time-varying activity patterns. An example of such an encoding relationship is the cosine tuning of firing rate with respect to the direction of hand motion. We present a systematic development of statistical encoding models for movement-related motor neurons using multielectrode array recordings during a two-dimensional (2-D) continuous pursuit-tracking task. Our approach avoids massive averaging of responses by utilizing 2-D normalized occupancy plots, cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN) system models and a method for describing variability in discrete random systems. We found that the expected firing rate of most movement-related motor neurons is related to the kinematic values by a linear transformation, with a significant nonlinear distortion in about 1/3 of the neurons. The measured variability of the neural responses is markedly non-Poisson in many neurons and is well captured by a "normalized-Gaussian" statistical model that is defined and introduced here. The statistical model is seamlessly integrated into a nearly-optimal recursive method for decoding movement from neural responses based on a Sequential Monte Carlo filter.},

@article{Kondo2015a,
abstract = {It has been debated whether orientation selectivity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) is derived from tuned lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) inputs or computed from untuned LGN inputs. However, few studies have measured orientation tuning of LGN axons projecting to V1. We measured the response properties of mouse LGN axons terminating in V1 and found that LGN axons projecting to layer 4 were generally less tuned for orientation than axons projecting to more superficial layers of V1. We also found several differences in response properties between LGN axons and V1 neurons in layer 4. These results suggest that orientation selectivity of mouse V1 may not simply be inherited from LGN inputs, but could also depend on thalamocortical or V1 circuits.},

But neurons exhibit important nonlinear behaviors, such as gain control, that are not captured by such analyses. We describe a spike-triggered covariance method for retrieving suppressive components of the gain control signal in a neuron. We demonstrate the method in simulation and on retinal ganglion cell data. Analysis of physiological data reveals significant suppressive axes and explains neural nonlinearities. This method should be applicable to other sensory areas and modalities.},

@article{Tsukamoto2001c,
abstract = {Because the mouse retina has become an important model system, we have begun to identify its specific neuron types and their synaptic connections. Here, based on electron micrographs of serial sections, we report that the wild-type mouse retina expresses the standard rod pathways known in other mammals: (1) rod --{\textgreater} cone (via gap junctions) to inject rod signals into the cone bipolar circuit; and (2) rod --{\textgreater} rod bipolar --{\textgreater} AII amacrine --{\textgreater} cone bipolar --{\textgreater} ganglion cell. The mouse also expresses another rod circuit: a bipolar cell with cone input also receives rod input at symmetrical contacts that express ionotropic glutamate receptors (Hack et al., 1999, 2001). We show that this rod-cone bipolar cell sends an axon to the outer (OFF) strata of the inner plexiform layer to form ribbon synapses with ganglion and amacrine cells. This rod-cone bipolar cell receives direct contacts from only 20{\%} of all rod terminals. However, we also found that rod terminals form gap junctions with each other and thus establish partial syncytia that could pool rod signals for direct chemical transmission to the OFF bipolar cell. This third rod pathway probably explains the rod responses that persist in OFF ganglion cells after the well known rod pathways are blocked (Soucy et al., 1998).},

@article{Palangi2016,
abstract = {This paper develops a model that addresses sentence embedding, a hot topic in current natural language processing research, using recurrent neural networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. Due to its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model is found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and detects the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords are found to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many different applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document retrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform several existing state of the art methods. We emphasize that the proposed model generates sentence embedding vectors that are specially useful for web document retrieval tasks. A comparison with a well known general sentence embedding method, the Paragraph Vector, is performed. The results show that the proposed method in this paper significantly outperforms it for web document retrieval task.},

@article{Brown1999a,
abstract = {A new technique for the determination of the two-photon uncaging action cross section (deltau) of photolyzable calcium cages is described. This technique is potentially applicable to other caged species that can be chelated by a fluorescent indicator dye, as well as caged fluorescent compounds. The two-photon action cross sections of three calcium cages, DM-nitrophen, NP-EGTA, and azid-1, are studied in the range of excitation wavelengths between 700 and 800 nm. Azid-1 has a maximum deltau of approximately 1.4 GM at 700 nm, DM-nitrophen has a maximum deltau of approximately 0.013 GM at 730 nm, and NP-EGTA has no measurable uncaging yield. The equations necessary to predict the amount of cage photolyzed and the temporal behavior of the liberated calcium distribution under a variety of conditions are derived. These equations predict that by using 700-nm light from a Ti:sapphire laser focused with a 1.3-NA objective, essentially all of the azid-1 within the two-photon focal volume would be photolyzed with a 10-micros pulse train of approximately 7 mW average power. The initially localized distributions of free calcium will dissipate rapidly because of diffusion of free calcium and uptake by buffers. In buffer-free cytoplasm, the elevation of the calcium concentration at the center of the focal volume is expected to last for approximately 165 micros.},

abstract = {Decoding the wiring diagram of the retina requires simultaneous observation of activity in identified neuron populations. Available recording methods are limited in their scope: electrodes can access only a small fraction of neurons at once, whereas synthetic fluorescent indicator dyes label tissue indiscriminately. Here, we describe a method for studying retinal circuitry at cellular and subcellular levels combining two-photon microscopy and a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using specific viral and promoter constructs to drive expression of GCaMP3, we labeled all five major neuron classes in the adult mouse retina. Stimulus-evoked GCaMP3 responses as imaged by two-photon microscopy permitted functional cell type annotation. Fluorescence responses were similar to those measured with the small molecule dye OGB-1. Fluorescence intensity correlated linearly with spike rates {\textgreater}10 spikes/s, and a significant change in fluorescence always reflected a significant change in spike firing rate. GCaMP3 expression had no apparent effect on neuronal function. Imaging at subcellular resolution showed compartment-specific calcium dynamics in multiple identified cell types.},

abstract = {Little is known about the spatial vision of mice or of the role the visual cortex plays in mouse visual perception. In order to provide baseline information upon which to evaluate the spatial vision of experimentally and genetically altered mice, we used the visual water task to assess the contrast sensitivity and grating acuity of normal C57BL/6 mice. We then ablated striate cortex (V1) bilaterally and re-measured the same visual functions. Intact mice displayed an inverse "U"-shaped contrast sensitivity curve with a maximum sensitivity near 0.2 cycles/degree (c/d). Grating acuity, measured either by discriminating a sine-wave grating from an equiluminant gray, or vertical from horizontal sine wave gratings, was near 0.55 c/d. Grating acuity and contrast sensitivity were reduced significantly following aspiration of V1. The mouse visual system exhibits fundamental mammalian characteristics, including the feature that striate cortex is involved in processing visual information with the highest sensitivity and spatial frequency. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we propose and demonstrate an optical system for the generation of such spatiotemporally engineered light pulses using a combination of spatial control by a two-dimensional reconfigurable light modulator, with a dispersive optical setup for temporal focusing. We show that although the properties of a holographic beam significantly differ from those of plane-wave illumination used in previous temporal focusing realizations, this leads only to a slightly reduced axial resolution. We show that the system can provide scanningless, arbitrarily shaped, depth resolved excitation patterns that offer new perspectives for multiphoton photoactivation and optical lithography applications.},

The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call "global" approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat.},

abstract = {Explains the complete design of a brain-computer interface chip Written by and oriented to electronic engineers Focuses on implanted devices Neuronal electronic interfaces carry significant potential for scientific research and medical applications. Neuroprosthetics may help to restore damaged sensory and motor brain functionality. Neuronal interfaces are evolving into complex micro-fabricated arrays of hundreds or thousands of sensors, and require tighter integration, advanced embedded computation, and wireless communication. At the very least, the electronic circuit of the implanted neuronal interface must acquire the data and transmit it outside. However, the huge data rates produced by large-scale neuronal interfaces exceed the communication bandwidth provided by low-power wireless channels. Hence, extensive embedded computations must be integrated into the interface in order to reduce the amount of transmitted data. This book presents the Neuroprocessor, a novel computational neuronal interface device implemented in VLSI technology. In addition to neuronal signals acquisition, it can process the data, generate stimuli and transmit the data over wireless channels, while using minimum electric energy. The NeuroProcessor opens with a brief background on neuronal communication and microelectrode recording. It introduces three generations of the Neuroprocessor and presents their architecture, circuits and algorithms. Applications to a miniature head-stage for in-vivo experiments and multi-electrode arrays for in-vitro studies are described.},

abstract = {M{\"{u}}ller glial cells within the retina may respond to different signaling molecules with an elevation of their intracellular free calcium. To prove the localization of the recorded calcium responses in M{\"{u}}ller cells within acutely isolated retinal wholemounts, retinal pieces from adult animals and humans were exposed to different vital dyes just after the calcium imaging records were finished. The dyes, Mitotracker Orange, Mitotracker Green, Celltracker Orange, Celltracker Green, and monochlorobimane, are all selectively taken up by M{\"{u}}ller glial cells, while neuronal cells remain largely devoid of the dyes. By using this method, it can be demonstrated that the free calcium alterations within the wholemounts indeed occur within M{\"{u}}ller cells. Moreover, the cross-sectional areas of (dye-filled) M{\"{u}}ller glial cell bodies, as well as of (dye-free) neuronal cell bodies, can be measured in retinal wholemounts, and the spatial densities of both types of cells can be determined. The vital dye loading of M{\"{u}}ller cells may facilitate investigations of stimulus-induced alterations of retinal glial cell physiology and morphology.},

abstract = {Complex but coordinated interactions involving ensembles of neuronal cells result in the accurate processing of information in the adult central nervous system. However, recent studies monitoring the global patterns of activity of neuronal populations have demonstrated that immature neurons also interact to produce coordinated patterns of activity during the early stages of development. In particular, these patterns of coordinated activity occur during the period when neuronal connections are established, thus leading us to believe that such activity patterns might underlie the precision to which many neural pathways are wired up. Multielectrode recording and calcium imaging are two of the techniques that have been instrumental in revealing the spatial and temporal properties of the coordinated activity of developing neural networks in vitro. While multielectrode arrays measure the action potential activity of the cells, calcium imaging permits changes in intracellular calcium levels to be monitored over time. Both techniques have been used successfully to monitor the activity of cellular networks in culture, but they have also been applied in assessing the patterns of activity in intact or semi-intact pieces of neural tissues, such as the developing retina, neocortex and spinal cord. More recently, it has also been possible to correlate the structure and function of the cellular components of the networks by combining intracellular dye filling with the multineuronal recordings. In this review, brief descriptions and the applications of the two techniques will be presented, and the advantages and limitations of multielectrode array will be compared with that of calcium imaging using recordings of the developing mammalian retina as the primary example.},

@article{Cruz-Martin2014a,
abstract = {How specific features in the environment are represented within the brain is an important unanswered question in neuroscience. A subset of retinal neurons, called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), are specialized for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field. Despite extensive study of the retinal circuitry that endows DSGCs with their unique tuning properties, their downstream circuitry in the brain and thus their contribution to visual processing has remained unclear. In mice, several different types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual thalamic structure that harbours cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective information computed at the level of the retina is routed to cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels, however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic circuit mapping and functional imaging of visually driven calcium signals in thalamocortical axons. This circuit pools information from several types of DSGCs, converges in a specialized subdivision of the dLGN, and delivers direction-tuned and orientation-tuned signals to superficial V1. Notably, this circuit is anatomically segregated from the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway carrying non-direction-tuned visual information to deeper layers of V1, such as layer 4. Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally specialized, parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of which originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction- and orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide evidence that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1 neurons may be influenced by the activation of DSGCs.},

abstract = {IntroductionGastric bypass surgery (GBP) leads to sustained weight loss and significant improvement in type 2 diabetes. Bile acids, signaling molecules which influence glucose metabolism, are a potential mediator for the improvement in diabetes after GBP. This study sought to investigate the effect of GBP on bile acid levels and composition in individuals with type 2 diabetes.MethodsPlasma bile acid levels and composition and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-19 levels were measured during fasting and in response to an oral glucose load before and at 1 month and 2 years post-GBP in 13 severely obese women with type 2 diabetes.ResultsA striking temporal change in bile acid levels and composition was observed after GBP. During the fasted state, bile acid concentrations were generally reduced at 1 month, but increased 2 years post-GBP. Postprandial bile acid levels were unchanged 1 month post-GBP, but an exaggerated postprandial peak was observed 2 years after surgery. A significant increase in the 12$\alpha$-hydroxylated/non12$\alpha$-hydroxylated bile acid ratio during fasting and postprandially at 2 years, but not 1 month, post-GBP was observed. Significant correlations between bile acids vs. FGF-19, body weight, the incretin effect, and peptide YY (PYY) were also found.ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that GBP temporally modifies the concentration and composition of circulating bile acids in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and suggests that bile acids may be linked to the improvement in type 2 diabetes after GBP.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 20 January 2015. doi:10.1038/ijo.2015.1.},

We detected single action potential-evoked calcium transients with signal-to-noise ratios of 2-5 and determined spike times with near-millisecond precision and 5-15 ms confidence intervals. An automated 'peeling' algorithm enabled reconstruction of complex spike trains from fluorescence traces up to 20-30 Hz frequency, uncovering spatiotemporal trial-to-trial variability of sensory responses in barrel cortex and visual cortex.

abstract = {Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20{\%} more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40{\%} more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

abstract = {We generated transgenic mice in which red, green, yellow, or cyan fluorescent proteins (together termed XFPs) were selectively expressed in neurons. All four XFPs labeled neurons in their entirety, including axons, nerve terminals, dendrites, and dendritic spines. Remarkably, each of 25 independently generated transgenic lines expressed XFP in a unique pattern, even though all incorporated identical regulatory elements (from the thyl gene). For example, all retinal ganglion cells or many cortical neurons were XFP positive in some lines, whereas only a few ganglion cells or only layer 5 cortical pyramids were labeled in others. In some lines, intense labeling of small neuronal subsets provided a Golgi-like vital stain. In double transgenic mice expressing two different XFPs, it was possible to differentially label 3 neuronal subsets in a single animal.},

abstract = {Detection of image motion direction begins in the retina, with starburst amacrine cells (SACs) playing a major role. SACs generate larger dendritic Ca(2+) signals when motion is from their somata towards their dendritic tips than for motion in the opposite direction. To study the mechanisms underlying the computation of direction selectivity (DS) in SAC dendrites, electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli were measured via somatic whole-cell recordings and quantified using Fourier analysis. Fundamental and, especially, harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli. This DS persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonics indicates nonlinearity, which, as the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and holding potential indicates, is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. [Ca(2+)] changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps and monitored by two-photon microscopy suggest that the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input, and that high-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels are active at rest. Supported by compartmental modeling, we conclude that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination.},

abstract = {Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) models are a popular and powerful tool for describing encoding (stimulus-response) transformations by single sensory as well as motor neurons. Recently, there has been rising interest in the second- and higher-order correlation structure of neural spike trains, and how it may be related to specific encoding relationships. The distortion of signal correlations as they are transformed through particular LNP models is predictable and in some cases analytically tractable and invertible. Here, we propose that LNP encoding models can potentially be identified strictly from the correlation transformations they induce, and develop a computational method for identifying minimum-phase single-neuron temporal kernels under white and colored random Gaussian excitation. Unlike reverse-correlation or maximum-likelihood, correlation-distortion based identification does not require the simultaneous observation of stimulus-response pairs-only their respective second order statistics. Although in principle filter kernels are not necessarily minimum-phase, and only their spectral amplitude can be uniquely determined from output correlations, we show that in practice this method provides excellent estimates of kernels from a range of parametric models of neural systems. We conclude by discussing how this approach could potentially enable neural models to be estimated from a much wider variety of experimental conditions and systems, and its limitations.},

abstract = {Neural word representations have proven useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their ability to efficiently model complex semantic and syntactic word relationships. However, most techniques model only one representation per word, despite the fact that a single word can have multiple meanings or "senses". Some techniques model words by using multiple vectors that are clustered based on context. However, recent neural approaches rarely focus on the application to a consuming NLP algorithm. Furthermore, the training process of recent word-sense models is expensive relative to single-sense embedding processes. This paper presents a novel approach which addresses these concerns by modeling multiple embeddings for each word based on supervised disambiguation, which provides a fast and accurate way for a consuming NLP model to select a sense-disambiguated embedding. We demonstrate that these embeddings can disambiguate both contrastive senses such as nominal and verbal senses as well as nuanced senses such as sarcasm. We further evaluate Part-of-Speech disambiguated embeddings on neural dependency parsing, yielding a greater than 8{\%} average error reduction in unlabeled attachment scores across 6 languages.},

abstract = {Named Entity Linking (nel) grounds entity mentions to their corresponding node in a Knowledge Base (kb). Recently, a number of systems have been proposed for linking entity mentions in text to Wikipedia pages. Such systems typically search for candidate entities and then disambiguate them, returning either the best candidate or nil. However, comparison has focused on disambiguation accuracy, making it difficult to determine how search impacts performance. Furthermore, important approaches from the literature have not been systematically compared on standard data sets. We reimplement three seminal nel systems and present a detailed evaluation of search strategies. Our experiments find that coreference and acronym handling lead to substantial improvement, and search strategies account for much of the variation between systems. This is an interesting finding, because these aspects of the problem have often been neglected in the literature, which has focused largely on complex candidate ranking algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Span of the response scaled with electrode diameter for electrodes 60 $\mu$m and larger. Short stimulation pulse widths selectively activated cells nearest the electrode.

@article{Baldridge1996d,
abstract = {Cholinergic regulation of the activity of rabbit retinal ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells was investigated using optical recording of changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). Labeling of neurons in the mature retina was achieved by injecting calcium green-1 dextran (CaGD) into the isolated retina. Nicotine increased ganglion cell [Ca2+]i, affecting every loaded cell in some preparations; the pharmacology of nicotine was consistent with an action at neuronal nicotinic receptors, and specifically it was kappa-(neuronal-)bungarotoxin-sensitive but alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive. Muscarine also raised [Ca2+]i, but it was less potent than nicotine, affecting only a subpopulation of ganglion cells, with an M1-like muscarinic receptor pharmacology. Neither the nicotine- nor muscarine-induced increases of ganglion cell [Ca2+]i were blocked by the glutamate receptor antagonists 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and aminophosphonopentanoic acid. Therefore, the effects of cholinergic agonists on ganglion cell [Ca2+]i were not attributable to an indirect effect mediated by glutamatergic bipolar cells. The effects of nicotine and muscarine were abolished in calcium-free solution, indicating that the responses depend on calcium influx. Displaced (Cb) cholinergic amacrine cells were also loaded with CaGD and were identified by selective labeling with the nuclear dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole. Cb amacrine cells did not respond to either nicotine or muscarine, but responded vigorously to the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid. There is anatomical evidence indicating that cholinergic amacrine cells make synaptic contact with each other, but the present results do not support the hypothesis that communication between these cells is cholinergic.},

Using this theory, we show that neural discharge patterns convey time-varying information intermingled with the neuron's response characteristics. We review the basic techniques for analyzing single-neuron discharge patterns and describe what they reveal about the underlying point process model. By applying information theory and estimation theory to point processes, we describe the fundamental limits on how well information can be represented by and extracted from neural discharges.

abstract = {PURPOSE/AIM: To compare the efficacy of optical techniques with electrophysiological recordings for mapping retinal activity in response to electrical stimulation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole cell patch clamp, Ca(2+) imaging (Fluo-4-AM), and Na(+) imaging (CoroNa Green-AM) techniques were used to detect responses of neurons from mouse and salamander retina to electrical stimulation.

RESULTS: Synaptic currents were observed in ≥23{\%} of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), indicating presynaptic Ca(2+) increases in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Modest depolarization with 20-30 mM K(+) consistently evoked Ca(2+) responses measured with Fluo4, but Ca(2+) responses were almost never evoked by epiretinal stimulation. In salamander retina, responses were seen in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and IPL. In mouse retina, responses were also sometimes seen in the outer pexiform layer (OPL). OPL responses showed a longer latency than IPL responses, suggesting that outer retinal circuits do not trigger synaptic responses of RGCs. Simultaneous Ca(2+) imaging and electrophysiological recording of synaptic currents confirmed that Fluo4-loaded retinas remained responsive to stimulation. Epiretinal stimulation evoked action potentials in ≥67{\%} of RGCs. CoroNa Green detected Na(+) changes stimulated by 20 mM K(+), but epiretinal stimulation did not evoke detectable Na(+) responses. Simultaneous imaging and electrophysiological recording confirmed the health of CoroNa Green-loaded retinas. We confirmed stimulation efficacy by simultaneously recording Na(+) changes and electrophysiological responses.

CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that electrophysiological recordings show greater sensitivity than Na(+) or Ca(2+) imaging in response to electrical stimulation. The paucity of Ca(2+) responses is consistent with limited risk for Ca(2+)-mediated cell damage during electrical stimulation.},

abstract = {We analyse the convergence properties of three spike-triggered data analysis techniques. Our results are obtained in the setting of a probabilistic linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade neural encoding model; this model has recently become popular in the study of the neural coding of natural signals. We start by giving exact rate-of-convergence results for the common spike-triggered average technique. Next, we analyse a spike-triggered covariance method, variants of which have been recently exploited successfully by Bialek, Simoncelli and colleagues. Unfortunately, the conditions that guarantee that these two estimators will converge to the correct parameters are typically not satisfied by natural signal data. Therefore, we introduce an estimator for the LN model parameters which is designed to converge under general conditions to the correct model. We derive the rate of convergence of this estimator, provide an algorithm for its computation and demonstrate its application to simulated data as well as physiological data from the primary motor cortex of awake behaving monkeys. We also give lower bounds on the convergence rate of any possible LN estimator. Our results should prove useful in the study of the neural coding of high-dimensional natural signals.},

abstract = {When natural photoreception is disrupted, as in outer-retinal degenerative diseases, artificial stimulation of surviving nerve cells offers a potential strategy for bypassing compromised neural circuits. Recently, light-sensitive proteins that photosensitize quiescent neurons have generated unprecedented opportunities for optogenetic neuronal control, inspiring early development of optical retinal prostheses. Selectively exciting large neural populations are essential for eliciting meaningful perceptions in the brain. Here we provide the first demonstration of holographic photo-stimulation strategies for bionic vision restoration. In blind retinas, we demonstrate reliable holographically patterned optogenetic stimulation of retinal ganglion cells with millisecond temporal precision and cellular resolution. Holographic excitation strategies could enable flexible control over distributed neuronal circuits, potentially paving the way towards high-acuity vision restoration devices and additional medical and scientific neuro-photonics applications.},

abstract = {Electrical activity of electrogenic cells in neuronal and cardiac tissue can be recorded by means of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) that offer the unique possibility for non-invasive extracellular recording from as many as 60 sites simultaneously. Since its introduction 30 years ago, the technology and the related culture methods for electrophysiological cell and tissue assays have been continually improved and have found their way into many academic and industrial laboratories. Currently, this technology is attracting increased interest owing to the industrial need to screen selected compounds against ion channel targets in their native environment at organic, cellular, and sub-cellular level. As the MEA technology can be applied to any electrogenic tissue (i.e., central and peripheral neurons, heart cells, and muscle cells), the MEA biosensor is an ideal in vitro system to monitor both acute and chronic effects of drugs and toxins and to perform functional studies under physiological or induced pathophysiological conditions that mimic in vivo damages. By recording the electrical response of various locations on a tissue, a spatial map of drug effects at different sites can be generated, providing important clues about a drug's specificity. In this survey, examples of MEA biosensor applications are described that have been developed for drug screening and discovery and safety pharmacology in the field of cardiac and neural research. Additionally, biophysical basics of recording and concepts for analysis of extracellular electrical signals are presented.},

In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method specifically designed for NED. The proposed method jointly maps words and entities into the same continuous vector space. We extend the skip-gram model by using two models. The KB graph model learns the relatedness of entities using the link structure of the KB, whereas the anchor context model aims to align vectors such that similar words and entities occur close to one another in the vector space by leveraging KB anchors and their context words. By combining contexts based on the proposed embedding with standard NED features, we achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.1{\%} on the standard CoNLL dataset and 85.2{\%} on the TAC 2010 dataset. Our code and pre-trained vectors will be made available online.},

abstract = {Neuroprosthetic retinal interfaces depend upon the ability to bypass the damaged photoreceptor layer and directly activate populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To date, the preferred approach to this task largely relies on electrode array implants. We are currently pursuing two alternative methods for light-based direct activation of the RGCs. The first method is based on applying caged glutamate over the retina and uncaging it locally to obtain RGC excitation. The second method is to artificially cause RGCs to express Channelrhodopsin II (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. In addition to being non-contact, optical techniques lend themselves relatively easily to a variety of technologies for achieving patterned stimulation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing (DLP - DMD) technology, we have developed an optical stimulation system capable of controlled, large-scale, flexible stimulation of the retinal tissue with high temporal accuracy. In preliminary studies, we are performing patterned photo-stimulation experiments using samples of caged fluorescent probes and in rat retinas that were virally transfected with ChR2.},

The analysis of neuronal connectivity is possible with electron microscopy, but technological limitations have impeded the acquisition of high-resolution data on a large enough scale. Here we show, using serial block-face electron microscopy and two-photon calcium imaging, that the dendrites of mouse starburst amacrine cells make highly specific synapses with direction-selective ganglion cells depending on the ganglion cell's preferred direction. Our findings indicate that a structural (wiring) asymmetry contributes to the computation of direction selectivity. The nature of this asymmetry supports some models of direction selectivity and rules out others. It also puts constraints on the developmental mechanisms behind the formation of synaptic connections. Our study demonstrates how otherwise intractable neurobiological questions can be addressed by combining functional imaging with the analysis of neuronal connectivity using large-scale electron microscopy.},

Only short duration ({\textless}2 ms) retinal spikes were recorded in normal mice by postnatal day 28. However, in rd/rd mice, a slow wave component with approximately 100 ms duration was also recorded along with the spikes. We attempted to understand the mechanism of this slow wave component in degenerate retina by applying various synaptic blockers. With CNQX/AP-7, the glutamate antagonist (n = 7), the slow wave component disappeared while the normally less-dominant retinal spikes became more apparent. With strychnine, the glycine antagonist (n = 3) or picrotoxin, GABA antagonist (n = 3), the amplitude of the slow wave component increased. These suggest that a stronger excitatory glutamate input from bipolar cells to ganglion cells is the main contributor to this slow wave component in rd/rd mice.},

abstract = {Throughout the central nervous system, information about the outside world is represented collectively by large groups of cells, often arranged in a series of 2-dimensional maps connected by tracts with many fibers. To understand how such a circuit encodes and processes information, one must simultaneously observe the signals carried by many of its cells. This article describes a new method for monitoring the simultaneous electrical activity of many neurons in a functioning piece of retina. Extracellular action potentials are recorded with a planar array of 61 microelectrodes, which provides a natural match to the flat mosaic of retinal ganglion cells. The voltage signals are processed in real time to extract the spike trains from up to 100 neurons. We also present a method of visual stimulation and data analysis that allows a rapid characterization of each neuron's visual response properties. A randomly flickering display is used to elicit spike trains from the ganglion cell population. Analysis of the correlations between each spike train and the flicker stimulus results in a simple description of each ganglion cell's functional properties.

@article{Schejter2012a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To acquire and characterize cellular-resolved in vivo fluorescence images of optogenetic probes expressed in rodent retinal ganglion cells, by adapting a low-cost and simple fundus system based on a topical endoscope.

METHODS: A custom endoscope-based fundus system was constructed (adapted from the design of Paques and colleagues). Bright field and fluorescence images were acquired from head-fixed transgenic mice expressing Channelrhodopsin2-eYFP, and Sprague Dawley rats virally transfected with the optogenetic probe GCaMP3. Images were compared to in vitro images of the same structures and were analyzed.

RESULTS: The fundus system provides high-quality, high-resolution fluorescence images of the eye fundus that span the whole retina. The images allow resolving individual cells and axon bundles in the Channelrhodopsin2-eYFP mice and cellular-scale structures in the GCaMP3 expressing rats. The resolution in mouse eyes was estimated to be better than 20 $\mu$m (full width at half maximum) and is only marginally dependent on movement-related blurring.

CONCLUSIONS: The fluorescence-endoscopy fundus system provides a powerful yet simple and widely accessible tool for obtaining cellular resolved fluorescent images of optogenetic and other fluorescent probes.

TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The new system could prove to be a basic tool for non-invasive in vivo small animal retinal imaging in a wide array of translational vision applications, including the tracking of fluorescently tagged cells and the expression of gene-therapy and optogenetic vectors.},

abstract = {Light is the tool of the 21st century. New photosensitive tools offer the possibility to monitor and control neuronal activity from the sub-cellular to the integrative level. This ongoing revolution has motivated the development of new optical methods for light stimulation. Among them, it has been recently demonstrated that a promising approach is based on the use of wavefront shaping to generate optically confined extended excitation patterns. This was achieved by combining the technique of temporal focusing with different approaches for lateral light shaping including low numerical aperture Gaussian beams, holographic beams and beams created with the generalized phase contrast mthod. What is needed now is a precise characterization of the effect of scattering on hese different methods in order to extend their use for in depth excitation. Here we present a theoretical and experimental study on the effect of scattering on the propagation of wavefront shaped beams. Results from fixed and acute cortical slices show that temporally focused spatial patterns are extremely robust against the effects of scattering and this permits their three-dimensional confinement for depths up to 550 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m.},

Investigations of the structural and functional organization of the vertebrate retina using live preparations have been facilitated by improvements in cell labeling methods, and by microscopy techniques that permit high-resolution of cells in vitro and in vivo. In particular, the generation of transgenic animals with fluorescently labeled retinal cells has permitted real-time visualization of cell generation, migration, differentiation and growth in the developing retina. Neuronal activity can also be examined by optical imaging using activity reporters directed to specific retinal cell types. Optical techniques such as multiphoton microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) have helped unravel the physiological properties and function of retinal cells. Here, we focus on the latest cell labeling methods that have proven highly useful in many aspects of retinal research. We also highlight several examples of how newly developed imaging technology itself has facilitated investigations that have advanced our understanding of retinal circuits and their development.},

abstract = {Genetic methods available in mice are likely to be powerful tools in dissecting cortical circuits. However, the visual cortex, in which sensory coding has been most thoroughly studied in other species, has essentially been neglected in mice perhaps because of their poor spatial acuity and the lack of columnar organization such as orientation maps. We have now applied quantitative methods to characterize visual receptive fields in mouse primary visual cortex V1 by making extracellular recordings with silicon electrode arrays in anesthetized mice. We used current source density analysis to determine laminar location and spike waveforms to discriminate putative excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, although the spatial scale of mouse receptive fields is up to one or two orders of magnitude larger, neurons show selectivity for stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency that is near to that found in other species. Furthermore, typical response properties such as linear versus nonlinear spatial summation (i.e., simple and complex cells) and contrast-invariant tuning are also present in mouse V1 and correlate with laminar position and cell type. Interestingly, we find that putative inhibitory neurons generally have less selective, and nonlinear, responses. This quantitative description of receptive field properties should facilitate the use of mouse visual cortex as a system to address longstanding questions of visual neuroscience and cortical processing.},

abstract = {A procedure is described for rapid concurrent synthesis on solid supports of hundreds of peptides, of sufficient purity to react in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Interaction of synthesized peptides with antibodies is then easily detected without removing them from the support. In this manner an immunogenic epitope of the immunologically important coat protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (type O1) is located with a resolution of seven amino acids, corresponding to amino acids 146-152 of that protein. Then, a complete replacement set of peptides in which all 20 amino acids were substituted in turn at every position within the epitope was synthesized, and the particular amino acids conferring specificity for the reaction with antibody were determined. It was found that the leucine residues at positions 148 and 151 were essential for reaction with antisera raised against intact virus. A lesser contribution was derived from the glutamine and alanine residues at positions 149 and 152, respectively. Aside from the practical significance for locating and examining epitopes at high resolution, these findings may lead to better understanding of the basis of antigen-antibody interaction and antibody specificity.},

Here we report recording and spike sorting techniques that enable us to record from all or nearly all of the ganglion cells in a patch of the retina. With a dense multi-electrode array, each ganglion cell produces a unique pattern of activity on many electrodes when it fires an action potential. Signals from all of the electrodes are combined with an iterative spike sorting algorithm to resolve ambiguities arising from overlapping spike waveforms. We verify that we are recording from a large fraction of ganglion cells over the array by labeling the ganglion cells with a retrogradely transported dye and by comparing the number of labeled and recorded cells. Using these methods, we show that about 60 receptive fields of ganglion cells cover each point in visual space in the salamander, consistent with anatomical findings.},

Here we infer a distance measure on the stimulus space directly from the recorded activity of 100 neurons in the salamander retina. In contrast to previously used measures of stimulus similarity, this “neural metric” tells us how distinguishable a pair of stimulus clips is to the retina, based on the similarity between the induced distributions of population responses. We show that the retinal distance strongly deviates from Euclidean, or any static metric, yet has a simple structure: we identify the stimulus features that the neural population is jointly sensitive to, and show the support-vector-machine-like kernel function relating the stimulus and neural response spaces. We show that the non-Euclidean nature of the retinal distance has important consequences for neural decoding.},

abstract = {The response of a neuron to a time-dependent stimulus, as measured in a Peri-Stimulus-Time-Histogram (PSTH), exhibits an intricate temporal structure that reflects potential temporal coding principles. Here we analyze the encoding and decoding of PSTHs for spiking neurons with arbitrary refractoriness and adaptation. As a modeling framework, we use the spike response model, also known as the generalized linear neuron model. Because of refractoriness, the effect of the most recent spike on the spiking probability a few milliseconds later is very strong. The influence of the last spike needs therefore to be described with high precision, while the rest of the neuronal spiking history merely introduces an average self-inhibition or adaptation that depends on the expected number of past spikes but not on the exact spike timings. Based on these insights, we derive a 'quasi-renewal equation' which is shown to yield an excellent description of the firing rate of adapting neurons. We explore the domain of validity of the quasi-renewal equation and compare it with other rate equations for populations of spiking neurons. The problem of decoding the stimulus from the population response (or PSTH) is addressed analogously. We find that for small levels of activity and weak adaptation, a simple accumulator of the past activity is sufficient to decode the original input, but when refractory effects become large decoding becomes a non-linear function of the past activity. The results presented here can be applied to the mean-field analysis of coupled neuron networks, but also to arbitrary point processes with negative self-interaction.},

@article{Reimer2012a,
abstract = {Measuring pairwise and higher-order spike correlations is crucial for studying their potential impact on neuronal information processing. In order to avoid misinterpretation of results, the tools used for data analysis need to be carefully calibrated with respect to their sensitivity and robustness. This, in turn, requires surrogate data with statistical properties common to experimental spike trains. Here, we present a novel method to generate correlated non-Poissonian spike trains and study the impact of single-neuron spike statistics on the inference of higher-order correlations. Our method to mimic cooperative neuronal spike activity allows the realization of a large variety of renewal processes with controlled higher-order correlation structure. Based on surrogate data obtained by this procedure we investigate the robustness of the recently proposed method empirical de-Poissonization (Ehm et al., 2007). It assumes Poissonian spiking, which is common also for many other estimation techniques. We observe that some degree of deviation from this assumption can generally be tolerated, that the results are more reliable for small analysis bins, and that the degree of misestimation depends on the detailed spike statistics. As a consequence of these findings we finally propose a strategy to assess the reliability of results for experimental data.},

abstract = {A long strand of empirical research has claimed that dropout cannot be applied between the recurrent connections of a recurrent neural network (RNN). The reasoning has been that the noise hinders the network's ability to model sequences, and instead should be applied to the RNN's inputs and outputs alone. But dropout is a vital tool for regularisation, and without dropout in recurrent layers our models overfit quickly. In this paper we show that a recently developed theoretical framework, casting dropout as approximate Bayesian inference, can give us mathematically grounded tools to apply dropout within the recurrent layers. We apply our new dropout technique in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and show that the new approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.},

In the present paper two filters approaches namely Gain ratio and Correlation based feature selection have been used to illustrate the significance of feature subset selection for classifying Pima Indian diabetic database (PIDD). The C4.5 tree uses gain ratio to determine the splits and to select the most important features. Genetic algorithm is used as search method with Correlation based feature selection as subset evaluating mechanism. The feature subset obtained is then tested using two supervised classification method namely, Back propagation neural network and Radial basis function network. Experimental results show that the feature subsets selected by CFS filter resulted in marginal improvement for both back propagation neural network and Radial basis function network classification accuracy when compared to feature subset selected by information gain filter.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a full-range complex and transmissive spatial light modulator (SLM) for simultaneous and independent amplitude and phase modulation of an input wave field. Arbitrary scalar complex optical fields are generated by stacking a pixelated liquid crystal display operating in phase-only (2$\pi$) modulation with passive polarization-sensitive components. The principle is based on optical combining the light fields of two neighboring phase-only modulating pixels, which were made orthogonally polarized by a structured half-wave plate, then passing through a birefringent plate to laterally shift one of the beams collinear to the other, and finally bringing to interference by a linear polarizer. Complex modulation by the proposed SLM is experimentally verified in monochrome green operation.},
